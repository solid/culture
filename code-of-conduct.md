## Standards of Behavior

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and acknowledging harm caused to those affected by
  our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community

* Taking constructive actions, and move towards consensus when possible

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
  any kind
* Trolling, insulting, derogatory or demeaning comments, and personal or
  political attacks
* Communicating in a tone and language that could lead to creating a hostile and
  unwelcoming environment
* Public or private harassment or threats. Harassment includes: offensive
  comments related to age, body size, visible or invisible disability,
  ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender, gender identity and expression, level
  of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
  appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation
  of an individual or group, unwelcome comments relating to any aspect of a
  person's lifestyle choices and personal life, deliberate misgendering and use
  of "dead" or rejected names, stalking and intimidation
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address or
  any aspect of a person's identity, without their explicit permission

  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Instances of Code of Conduct violations will be handled by the Code of Conduct
Committee.

The Code of Conduct Committee are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our
standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective
action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening,
offensive, or harmful.

The Code of Conduct Committee have the right and responsibility to remove, edit,
or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for
moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including but not
limited to the Gitter chat rooms, Solid forum, and GitHub repositories, and also
applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public
spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

All community members are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident. Reports will be handled under confidentiality.

## Enforcement Guidelines

The Code of Conduct Committee will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in
determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code
of Conduct:

### Continued behavior

A pattern of continued violations of community standards will be determined
using a "three-strikes system".  
Three strikes will constitute a pattern of behavior, and it may lead to a
temporary ban. Continued violations beyond three strikes may lead to a permanent
ban. However, severe offenses may lead to a temporary or permanent ban
regardless of the number of strikes. This applies to all violations of the Code
of Conduct as described below.

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from the Code of Conduct Committee,
providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why
the behavior was inappropriate.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of
actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
unsolicited interaction with the people involved in the incident(s), including
unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a
specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community
spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may
lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms will lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
community.
